An introduction of your research question
How accessible are public parks and bike lanes in public housing communities and other low-income communities?

An explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake
We understand form our own upringing that parks and bike lanes are disproportionately inaccessible to low-income people. It should matter to others because access to parks and bikelanes that provide outdoor space and transportation opportunities. If low-income communities are allowed greater access to parks and bikelines, we can witness physical and mental health benefits.    

A description of the spatial scope (e.g. Boyle Heights or Hong Kong), and why space and/or time matters for your project
Los Angeles. We would like to explore inequities in access to parks and bikelanes in one of the largest cities in Southern California, the United States, and the world.

A preliminary but definitive description of data sources (at least two) that you will use
Census Data
Park Data (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/department-of-recreation-and-parks-gis-map-of-park-boundaries)
Bikelane Data (https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/230abc621b144dbc96cca83d65bd454d_0?geometry=-118.445%2C34.058%2C-118.404%2C34.065 AND https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?layers=230abc621b144dbc96cca83d65bd454d)
Public Housing Data

A scope that explains the intended analysis and resulting visualizations for your project
The spatial proximity of parks and bikelanes to public housing and other low-income communities. Vice versa, are parks and bike lanes more accessible to higher communities? Resulting viualization is a map of bikelanes, parks, public housing sites, and median household income by census tract.
