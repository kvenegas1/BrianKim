An introduction of your research question
How accessible are public parks and bike lanes in public housing communities and other low-income communities?
An explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake
We understand form our own upringing that parks and bike lanes are disproportionately inaccessible to low-income people. It should matter to others because access to parks and bikelanes that provide outdoor space and transportation opportunities. If low-income communities are allowed greater access to parks and bikelines, we can witness physical and mental health benefits.
