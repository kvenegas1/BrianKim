# LA Park Access #
**An introduction of your research question:**

Since the pandemic began, access to outdoor spaces and activites have become more important in maintaining physical and mental health. We are curious in researching how access to these amenities may vary by socioeconomic status of Los Angeles's communities.


Our research question is: How accessible are parks and other public recreation facilities in the lowest income neighborhoods and highest income neighborhoods in LA city?

We will answer this question by creating an interactive map of median household income by census tract and park locations in the City of Los Angeles. In addition, we will look deeper into accessability to parks and other public recreation facilities in one of Los Angeles' highest income census tracts.


**An explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake:**

We chose this topic because we have both benefited from access to parks and outdoor space during the lockdown and believe that everyone should have access to these amenities. In absence of these amenities, people are more likely to stay home, which can lead to less exercise, increased stress, and deteriorating mental health.


**A description of the spatial scope (e.g. Boyle Heights or Hong Kong), and why space and/or time matters for your project:**

We chose Los Angeles because it is experiencing the highest rates of COVID-19 cases in the U.S and thus the most strict shelter-in-place orders. Therefore, LA residents are more dependent on access to outdoor open spaces where they can participate in healthy and safe socially-distanced activities.


**A preliminary but definitive description of data sources (at least two) that you will use:**

The first data source is median household income census data for the City of Los Angeles. This will be important to visualize the differences in socio-economic status between census tracts. 

The second data source is park data from LA Department of Recreation and Parks for the City of Los Angeles. This will be used to locate parks and other public recreation facilities.

**A scope that explains the intended analysis and resulting visualizations for your project:**

We will conduct a spatial analysis by measuring the proximity of parks and and other public recreation facilities to lower income census tracts. The resulting viualization will be a map of parks, and median household income by census tract. 

**A concluding paragraph of what insights you expect to gain from your research:**

We expect to determine whether there are disparities in access to parks and bike lanes in lower income census tracts. Furthermore, finding disparities would mean that there is a need for efforts aimed at increasing access to parks in low income communities.
