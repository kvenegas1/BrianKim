# Researching access to Parks and Bikelanes in Los Angeles #
Link to proposal: https://github.com/kvenegas1/BrianKim/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/Status%20Report https://github.com/kvenegas1/BrianKim/tree/main/Group%20Assignments

Roles (only for groups): Give each team member a title, and define what role each team member will play, and how each person plans to contribute to the project. While this may be subject to change, it is a good idea to define this early in the project to clarify "who is doing what."
Kim Venegas: Race data researcher, Bike lane data researcher. Acquire data for race and bike lanes. Create charts and maps for race and bike lanes.
Brian Ramirez: Income data researcher, Park data researcher. Acquire data for Income and Park lanes. Create charts and maps for income and parks.

Status update: Feeling optimistic and excited about the project. In the previous weeks, through the labs and group/individual assignments we have been able to become more comfortable with the data we will be using. Although overall the labs and assignments have been good, the most recent lab (the isochrones lab) was a bit more challenging to follow than the others. On the bright side, learning about isochrones will be incredibly useful for our project down the line. 
Data update: As of now, we have a majority of the data that we believe we will be using. This data includes census data, park data, and bike lane data. Also, it was helpful to use the race and income data in our labs and assignments because it provided us with practice in managing and manipulating the data.

Concerns: Major concerns: We are afraid of encountering issues with our data. Specifically, not having the appropriate data for our analysis or not being able to correctly implement the methods necessary to conduct our analysis. In addition, we both have data-related trauma from our previous GIS classes. Minor concerns: We are worried that our analysis will be too simple.
